== TODO ==

Timeline Events,Look&Feel:
- Add filter to disable the displaying of some events (based on type)
  - and/or add a way of disabling the capture of certain event types
- Add option of what market event text should be prefered?

Settings: 
- Add support for per element and order editing of lists.
- Add color settingstype
- Add color preview
- Add color picker
- Add a 'button' type, with a callback

Lines:
- Add linethickness parameters
- Make the square optional
- Repair Ally-lines' ally determination algorithm
? Fix concurrency bug with special locations.
? Add names to special locations - already done with the "village renamer" script? Probably an option. Though our script will need to be compatible with this script, detect changes and store the new name somewhere.
- Insert code to show swords on the map, for events? (<span class="m4"> on T3.5 only)

Event Capture:
- Make colors customizable, 
- Capture info/events off of the dorf3.php page (either natural data, or after a Beyond scan??)
- Keep track of merchants in each village
- Remove the event if you cancel it (eg for buildings or demolitions) or gold it.

Tool Tip:
- Keep track of the most recently completed task/building for each village, and provide link to it
- Add buttons next to listed events, to delete mistakes/changes event?
- Add HTML requests to get data on villages with expired info (a hidden iframe would probably do the trick here (script will run for that iframe), though has a lot of overhead)

New Features:
- Modify all the links for more robust navigation
- Add event synchronization between multiple browsers - store data in a link, piggyback on Xmarks?
- Add quicklinks (for quickly building/upgrading something in a given village) (maybe something in combination with the tool tip)
- Add task queue functionality
? Add a 'scan all villages' option, to automatically (and non-deterministically) visit all your villages and exract pertinent information --- NOT NEEDED if we impliment the HTML requests in Tooltip

BUGS:
- tl_date: constantly underestimates the time of an event by ~1 minute
- any comment starting with "BUG:"
- Confusion in identifying UID's, mixing up from other servers... FIX BEFORE RELEASE!
- Script cannot handle the destruction of a village (still shows up)
- Market events *can* get overwritten on their destination village, if land at the same time.
