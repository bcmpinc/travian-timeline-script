== TODO ==

Timeline Events,Look&Feel:
- Change the warp feature to use arcsinh. (And draw a nicer scalebar)
- Figure out a way to filter the events by village
- Add filter to disable the displaying of some events (based on type)
  - and/or add a way of disabling the capture of certain event types
- Capture warehouse/granary full events
- Add the colour of events to the options menu (might need to rework the options menu somewhat, it's getting kinda big...)
- Figure out a way to catch two different events occuring simultaneously (right now we just assume any simultaneous events are the *same* event)

Other Features:
- Add method for configuration of 'extra villages'
- Add names to special locations.
- Seperate GM_values etc for different accounts on the same server (ie sitters).

New Features:
- Modify all the links for more robust navigation
